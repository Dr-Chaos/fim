= How can you use Fim

== Download a Fim release

You can download a prebuilt release of Fim from the https://github.com/evrignaud/fim/releases/latest[image:icons/download.png[Download] Latest release] +
Then you have to:

* Untar / Unzip the Fim package
* Add the created directory into your PATH to be able to use the `fim` command

== Run Fim using Docker

If you don't have Java and you don't want to install it (or you don't have the required version of Java), you can run Fim using a Docker image. +
All the environment required to run Fim is inside the Docker image. Just pull the image and run Fim.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The Docker image runs only on Linux
====

=== Using the latest published Docker image

Fim releases are published as Docker images on https://hub.docker.com/r/evrignaud/fim/[Docker Hub]. +
You can use them like this.

==== Retrieve the `fim-docker` script:

[source, bash]
----
$ curl goo.gl/XwERDY -L -o fim-docker && chmod a+rx fim-docker
----

==== Run it:

This script takes the same arguments as the `fim` one. +
If you don't have the Fim Docker image locally it will pull the image first.

[source, bash]
----
$ ./fim-docker -h
----

If you want to use the latest version of the Fim Docker image you can pull it manually:

[source, bash]
----
$ docker pull evrignaud/fim
----

=== Creating your own Docker Image

After having build Fim (<<how-can-you-use-fim.adoc#_build_fim,see below>>), type the following command:
[source, bash]
----
$ ./build-docker-image
----

Then you can use the provided `fim-docker` script.

== Build Fim

You can build Fim yourself to try the master version.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Fim comes with versioned prebuilt release. I recommend using them as they are OK to be used. +
If you clone Fim's master, a SNAPSHOT is retrieved and there is no guarantee that this particular build of Fim will work properly.
====

* Get the code
** Download the https://github.com/evrignaud/fim/zipball/master[.zip] or the https://github.com/evrignaud/fim/tarball/master[.tar.gz]
** Or clone it using `https://github.com/evrignaud/fim.git`
* Build it by typing the following command (follow <<how-can-you-use-fim.adoc#_step_by_step_procedure,this procedure>> for more details):

[source, bash]
----
mvn clean install
----

* You can run the jar file generated into the `target` directory using
the two shell script files located in the root directory.

** `fim` for Linux or Mac OS X
** `fim.bat` for Windows

It generates also two distribution files into the `target/dist` directory.

[source, bash]
----
$ ls -a1 target/dist/
fim-1.1.0-SNAPSHOT-distribution.tar.gz
fim-1.1.0-SNAPSHOT-distribution.zip
----

=== Step by step procedure

Here are some tips on how you can build Fim easily.

==== Getting Maven

If you don't have Maven, you can either download it from https://maven.apache.org/index.html[the Apache website] or use a packages manager.

===== For Linux

[source, bash]
----
$ sudo apt-get install maven
----

===== For Mac OS X

First install https://brew.sh[Homebrew] if you don't have it.

[source, bash]
----
$ ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
----

Then install Maven.

[source, bash]
----
$ brew install maven
----

Then you need to add the `maven/bin` directory into your `PATH`.

==== Clone Fim

[source, bash]
----
$ cd
$ mkdir projects
$ cd projects
$ git clone https://github.com/evrignaud/fim.git
$ cd fim
----

==== Build Fim

[source, bash]
------
$ mvn clean install
------

==== Now Fim is ready

[source, bash]
------
$ ./fim
------
