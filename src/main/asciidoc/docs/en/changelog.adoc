=== General
* 'diff' command deprecated in favor of the 'status' command
* Fix https://github.com/evrignaud/fim/issues/6[issue #6] - Add commitDetails into the State in order to display more details regarding each commit while running 'fim log'.
The 'log' command displays now the same output as the 'status' command. It works completely with States generated with this version of Fim
* Thanks to https://twitter.com/nch3v[@nch3v], clarified the 'find-duplicates' command output and sort duplicate sets by wasted space to display the biggest first
* Fim is now able to *remove duplicates* that are in the repository. See more in <<dealing-with-duplicates.adoc#_remove_duplicates,Remove duplicates>>
* Add http://evrignaud.github.io/fim/slides/fr[French slides]

=== Bug fix
* Update memory maximum sizes to more accurate values
* In `fim-docker`, don't use the `realpath` command that is not installed by default

== Version 1.2.0

=== Global improvement of the performance
* **Decrease the State size** in memory and on the disc by using Ascii85 instead of Hexa to store hash. Each hash string length is now 80 instead of 128.
* Add **Super-fast commit** support. See more in <<index.adoc#_super_fast_commit,Super-fast commit>>
* Allow to **manage a very big amount a files** (1 098 138 files is working for me)
* **Optimisation of the State comparison** to be able to compare quickly two States that contains 1 000 000 files

=== General
* Fim is now distributed as **Docker image** on Docker Hub. See more in <<how-can-you-use-fim.adoc#_run_fim_using_docker,Run Fim using Docker>>
* Add the **`--directory`** option to be able to specify where to run Fim commands
* Every commit on Fim is now tested on **Mac OS X** thanks to the Travis Mac builder
* Run static code analysis on **Sonar** and **Coverity**
* Add the **`--purge-states`** option that purge previous States if the commit succeed

=== Bug fix
* Check access rights for the `.fim` directory before executing every command
* Ignore the milliseconds for date modification comparison because some JDK don't retrieve them and set them to 0
* By default truncate output to 200 lines of the same kind. `--output-max-lines` option added to modify this
* Empty files are not seen as duplicates

=== Migrating from 1.1.0 to 1.2.0

State format is modified and not compatible. You need the rehash the complete repository. +
