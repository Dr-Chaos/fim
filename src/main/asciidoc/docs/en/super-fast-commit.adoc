= Super-fast commit

Fim is able to commit using the super-fast mode (or fast mode). In that case, it checks into the repository for modifications using the selected mode. +
And then it do a full hash of the modified files in order to fill up the missing hash. +
*Using Super-fast commit allow to save a lot of time.* With this option you can miss some modified files.

This means that even if the global hash mode of your repository is hash all, you can commit using either fast mode or super-fast mode.

Super-fast commit example:

[source, bash]
------
$ fim init -y -c "Create the repository slowly in full mode"
Info  - Scanning recursively local files, using 'full' mode and 2 threads
...

# Do some modifications

$ fim ci -s -y -c "Commit modifications very quickly using super-fast commit"
Info  - Scanning recursively local files, using 'super-fast' mode and 2 threads
...
Info  - Retrieving the missing hash for all the modified files, using 'full' mode and 2 threads
...

# Do some modifications

$ fim ci -f -y -c "Commit modifications quickly using fast commit"
Info  - Scanning recursively local files, using 'fast' mode and 2 threads
...
Info  - Retrieving the missing hash for all the modified files, using 'full' mode and 2 threads
