== Initialize the big Fim repository

Here is the output of the initialization of a big Fim repository that contains 297 GB of photos and videos. +
In my case *it takes almost 3 hours* to hash all the file contents.

[source, bash]

photos-videos$ fim init -y

== Check the status very quickly

It is possible to check the status very quickly using the super-fast mode using the `-s` option that will check only 3 small blocks of 4 KB. +
In my case *it takes 17 minutes :=)*.

== Check the status more accurately

Using the super-fast mode can produce inaccurate results. *You can miss some modified files.* +
To increase accuracy, you can use the fast mode using the `-f` option that will check 3 medium blocks. +
Even if, using this mode increase accuracy, it cannot be completely accurate as we only hash 3 different 1 MB blocks of the files. +
This time in my case, *it takes 42 minutes* to check the status.

== Full status checking

If you want to be completely sure of the `status` result, you need to run a full hash of all the file contents using the `status` command without any option. +
This time in my case, *it takes almost 3 hours* as for the `init` command.

== Checking without hashing

There is also the do not hash mode using the `-n` option that will not hash the file contents.
It helps to detect faster changes but you will be able to detect only file names and file attributes that have changed. +
This time in my case, *it takes 46 seconds*.
