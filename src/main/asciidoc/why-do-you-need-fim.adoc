= Why do you need Fim

You can check the integrity of you files using filesystems capabilities. For example `btrfs` comes with the
https://github.com/kdave/btrfs-progs/blob/devel/Documentation/btrfs-scrub.asciidoc[scrub] command that reads all data from the disk and verifies checksums.

Fim has a different use case. It allows you to see files you are working on that you have modified, moved or deleted. +
With `btrfs` all those files would have appeared as OK.

Fim allows you also to check the integrity of files with filesystems that do not maintain file checksums. +
For example you will be able to detect hardware corruption on a DVD. You simply have to burn the complete Fim repository on the DVD, all the files and the `.fim` content. +
You can verify the integrity of this DVD by going on the top of the DVD and type `fim st` or `fim dcor`.

The Fim States could also be corrupted. To do so the State content is hashed and each time Fim loads a State, it checks his integrity by recalculating the State hash.
