== What is Fim

{empty} +

*With Fim you can:*

* Check the integrity of files that can be large and binary, +
therefore not comparable (.doc, .jpg, .png, .mp3, .mp4, ...)
* Know quickly the list files that would have been +
renamed, moved, deleted or corrupted. +
This can happen accidentally
* Keep a log of changes done on these files and display later a detailed log of these changes
* Search duplicate files and possibly to delete them then

{empty} +

_More details in the use cases that follow..._

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* This presentation does not provide all the solutions

* It allows you to think and ask questions
--

== Why I wrote Fim

{empty} +

* A tool like Git is able to manage large binary files
* But with Git the local workspace occupies at least double the space because there is all the content of the repository in the .git
* And with Git you cannot permanently delete a file. +
It will always exist in the Git history
* Moreover all the contents of the modified files are retained. +
which takes a huge space with the time
* Some tools only work on specific file systems
(Example: https://github.com/kdave/btrfs-progs/blob/devel/Documentation/btrfs-scrub.asciidoc[btrfs-scrub])

The goal was to have a tool that can quickly show the status of the local workspace

== How it works

Fim creates the `.fim` directory in the workspace root. It is its repository. +
Inside it stores an index of files contained in the workspace. +

The index contains for each file: +
&mdash; Name and size +
&mdash; Attributes (dates, permissions) +
&mdash; 3 small blocks hash +
&mdash; 3 medium blocks hash +
&mdash; Complete hash of the file

The index is called the `State` and the hash are done using SHA-512

A new `State` is created at each commit

The data of the files are not retained.
One can thus put Fim in the category of the *UVCS* (UnVersioned System Control)

{empty} +

http://evrignaud.github.io/fim/#_how_does_it_work[Details]

== Fim workflow

*1/ Create the repository Fim*

[source, bash]
----
fim init
----

*2/ Work on the files, modify*

\...

*3/ Know the state of the workspace*

[source, bash]
----
fim st         # 'status' command
----

*4/ Commit to save the current state* +

[source, bash]
----
fim ci -m "My commit comment"
----

*5/ Display the history*

[source, bash]
----
fim log
----

{empty} +

http://evrignaud.github.io/fim/#_fim_workflow[Details]

== Several hash modes

To get a faster status, Fim is able to hash only 3 blocks of the file
at the beginning, middle and end. +
You can use the options:

* `-f`: Fast mode. Hash 3 blocks of 1 MB

* `-s`: Super-fast mode. Hash 3 blocks of 4 KB

[source, bash]
----
fim st -f
----

[source, bash]
----
fim st -s
----

With the `-n` option (no hash) Fim just check the file names and the attributes

[source, bash]
----
fim st -n
----

{empty} +

http://evrignaud.github.io/fim/#_real_life_example[Details]

== !

image::demo-little.png[]

[source, bash]
----
mkdir test1
$ cd test1

$ for i in 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 10 ;
  do echo "New File $i" > file${i} ; done

$ fim init -m "First State"

# Modifications

$ fim st

$ fim ci -m "My modifications"

$ fim log
----

== Various use cases

{empty} +

* *Case 1* - Workspace management

* *Case 2* - Detect and remove duplicates inside a workspace

* *Case 3* - Duplicate files in another workspace

* *Case 4* - Backup integrity

== Case 1 - Workspace management

{empty} +

* Manage directories filled with binaries. +
For example: photos, music or movies

* Know the state of a workspace in which we work episodically

* Follow the developments over time

[source, bash]
----
fim st
----

Changes made

[source, bash]
----
fim ci -m "My commit comment"
----

{empty} +

> image:important.png[] *Fim does not backup the file contents.* +
> It is recommended to use a backup software

== Case 1 - Super-fast commit

{empty} +

The super-fast mode during a commit allows you to check the current status in super-fast mode
so that commit is faster. +
The modified files are then hashed again in full{nbsp}mode

[source, bash]
----
fim ci -s -y -m "Commit very quickly using super-fast commit"
----

{empty} +
{empty} +
{empty} +

http://evrignaud.github.io/fim/#_super_fast_commit[Details]

== Case 1 - Run the Fim commands from{nbsp}a{nbsp}sub-directory

Some commands are faster when they are executed from a sub-directory,
because they have less files to address:

* `st` (`status`): Know the status of the sub-directory
* `ci` (`commit`): Commit changes
* `fdup` (`find-duplicates`): Find duplicate files
* `rdup` (`remove-duplicates`): Delete duplicate files
* `rfa` (`reset-file-attrs`): Reset the files attributes

{empty} +

All other commands are working, but not quicker

{empty} +

http://evrignaud.github.io/fim/#_run_fim_commands_from_a_sub_directory[Details]

== case 1 - Ignore files or directories

{empty} +

You can add a `.fimignore` file at all the repository levels,
and also globally in the user home directory

Each line of the file contains the name of a file or directory to ignore. +
You can also use the following expressions:

* An asterisk to ignore several (Example: `*.mp3`)

* `\**/` at the beginning of the line. The remaining will be ignored in all sub directories.
For example, to ignore all the mp3 even those who are in sub directories:
`*\*/*.mp3`

{empty} +

http://evrignaud.github.io/fim/#_ignoring_files_or_directories[Details]

== Case 1 - Ignore some modifications

{empty} +

Limit the display with `-i` to ignore the changes on the:

* `attrs`: File attributes

* `dates`: Modification and creation dates

* `renamed`: Renamed files

[source, bash]
----
fim st -i attrs,dates,renamed
----

{empty} +

To ignore all kinds, indicate `all`

[source, bash]
----
fim st -i all
----

{empty} +

http://evrignaud.github.io/fim/#_ignore_some_difference_during_state_comparison[Details]

== Case 1 - Permissions management

It is important to ensure that the files keep their permissions. +
Fim backup and is able to restore. +
It stores for each file the following information:

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discretionary_access_control[DAC] - Discretionary access control: +
&mdash; On Linux and Mac OS, permissions *`rwxrwxrwx`* +
&mdash; On Windows, the *`Archive`*, *`Hidden`*, *`ReadOnly`* and *`System`* attributes

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandatory_access_control[MAC] - Mandatory access control: +
&mdash; On Linux, the *SELinux* label if supported

You can restore the permissions using the `rfa`{nbsp}(`reset-file-attrs`) command:

[source, bash]
----
fim rfa
----

http://evrignaud.github.io/fim/#_file_permissions_management[Details]

== Case 2 - Detect duplicates inside a workspace

{empty} +
{empty} +

Fim is able to display the duplicates contained in a workspace using the command `fdup` (`find-duplicates`):

[source,bash]
----
fim fdup
----

{empty} +

If the current state is already committed, you can skip the workspace scan phase by using the `-l` option:

[source,bash]
----
fim fdup -l
----

{empty} +
{empty} +

http://evrignaud.github.io/fim/#_search_for_duplicate_files[Details]

== Case 2 - Remove duplicates inside a{nbsp}workspace

{empty} +

It is possible to remove duplicate files.

&bull; Either in interactive:

[source,bash]
----
fim rdup
----

&bull; Or in automatic by keeping the first file in the duplicate set:

[source,bash]
----
fim rdup -y
----

{empty} +

In both cases, it is possible to use the current state as with `fdup` by adding the `-l` option:

----
fim rdup -l
----

== Case 3 - Duplicate files in{nbsp}another{nbsp}workspace

Fim can delete duplicate files contained in another workspace. +
For example an old backup out of sync where you want to keep only the files that you don't have. +
It removes locally all the files already contained in the master workspace.

For example, with `backup` which is a copy of the repository named `source`:

[source,bash]
----
cd backup
$ fim rdup -M ../source
----

{empty} +

When the workspace to clean is remote, you can just copy the `.fim` in an empty directory
and specify it as parameter of the `-m` option of the `rdup` command

{empty} +

http://evrignaud.github.io/fim/#_duplicates_that_are_outside[Details]

== Case 4 - Backup integrity

{empty} +

Fim allows you to check the integrity of files stored on any kind of file system.
In particular the offline backups.

To do so, add to the backup the corresponding Fim (`.fim`) repository

Then it will be possible to check with Fim the integrity of the data in the backup

For example, in the case of a DVD that contains a backup and the Fim repository,
you can go to the root and get the status:

[source,bash]
----
fim st
----

== Case 4 - Hardware corruption detection

image::hardware-corruption.png[]

Fim diagnose an hardware corruption if the content of the file has changed whereas the creation / modification dates have not been modified

It uses the `dcor` command (`detect-corruption`):

[source,bash]
----
fim dcor
----

> image:important.png[] *Fim can produce false positives* if the content has changed and the dates have been reset. For example with the `rfa` command

http://evrignaud.github.io/fim/#_hardware_corruption_detection[Details]

== Other Commands

{empty} +

* `dign` (`display-ignored`): +
Displays the files or directories ignored in the last State

* `rbk` (`rollback`): +
Removes the last committed State

* `pst` (`purge-states`): +
Purge old states. Keeps only the last

== How to use Fim

{empty} +

* You can download a Fim distribution +
https://github.com/evrignaud/fim/releases/latest[image:download.png[Download] Last release]

* or build a version from the master (http://evrignaud.github.io/fim/#_build_fim[Details])

{empty} +

.*Fim prerequisites*

* Fim is written in Java. It requires Java 8

* Works on Linux, Windows and Mac OS X

* Tested on those three platforms

== Fim Docker image

For Linux, if you do not have Java or not the correct version, +
a docker image is available on https://hub.docker.com/r/evrignaud/fim/[Docker Hub]
https://microbadger.com/images/evrignaud/fim[image:https://images.microbadger.com/badges/version/evrignaud/fim.svg[Image version]]
https://microbadger.com/images/evrignaud/fim[image:https://images.microbadger.com/badges/image/evrignaud/fim.svg[Image size]]

&bull; *Retrieve the `fim-docker` script*{nbsp}{nbsp}{nbsp}{nbsp}image:docker-little.png[]

[source,bash]
----
curl goo.gl/XwERDY -L -o fim-docker && chmod a+rx fim-docker
----

&bull; *Launch Fim*

The script retrieves the Fim Docker image, then starts. +
It takes the same arguments as the `fim` command

[source,bash]
----
./fim-docker -h
----

&bull; *Update the image used*

[source,bash]
----
docker pull evrignaud/fim
----

== Hands on

image::hands-on-little.png[]

+++<u>Ideas to try it yourself:</u>+++

* http://evrignaud.github.io/fim/#_simple_example[simple-example]

* http://evrignaud.github.io/fim/#_duplicates_that_are_outside[remove-duplicates-example]

== `.fim` content

* The `.fim` directory contains:

** A file with the repository settings: `settings.json`
** A file for each state. It's a JSON compressed file

{empty} +

.*The State*

* It contains a global hash which ensures the integrity. +
Fim don't allow to use a modified state

* The content of the State is standardized and can be used on the different supported OS

* http://evrignaud.github.io/fim/#_state_file_content[Preview of a State content]

== Changing The default hash mode

{empty} +

During the Fim repository initialization you can ask to not use some hash.
This allows to have a repository where the commit will be faster, but there could be collisions:

&bull; `-f`: Max. hash mode: fast. You can use after `-f`, `-s` or `-n`

&bull; `-s`: Max. hash mode: super-fast. You can use after `-s` or `-n`

&bull; `-n`: Max. hash mode: no-hash. You can use after `-n`

+++<u>Example:</u>+++

[source,bash]
----
fim init -f
----

After the `status` command works by default with the 'fast' level.

[source,bash]
----
fim st    # Runs using '-f'
----

http://evrignaud.github.io/fim/#_changing_default_hash_mode[Details]

== The hash algorithm used

{empty} +

* The hash algorithm is SHA-512

* SHA-512 is 2 * slower than MD5. It's a cryptographic algorithm. +
This decrease collisions

* The size of the key produced (512 Bit / 64 bytes) allows to minimize the collision risk on large files

* The disk is slower than the hash algorithm

* When the status is checked in full mode, the 3 hash are used which decrease the risk of collision

== Performances

image::performance.png[]

* Fim can manage at least 1 million of files

* Multi-thread hash in order to take advantage of the resources

* In many cases, performance are conditioned by the speed of the disk

* By default, the number of thread is dynamic and depends on the disk throughput

* `-t` option to change the number of threads used (http://evrignaud.github.io/fim/#_hash_files_in_multi_thread[Details])

== Hashing process

A Thread scans the workspace and fills the
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/index.html?java/util/concurrent/LinkedBlockingDeque.html[Queue] of files to hash

Several thread hash each one a file:

&mdash; Calculation of the size and the location of the next block

&mdash; Block mapped into memory using a NIO https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/index.html?java/nio/channels/FileChannel.html[FileChannel]

&mdash; Hashing or not by the 3 hashers that produce the 3 hash +
{nbsp}{nbsp}{nbsp}{nbsp}{nbsp}Using the https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/index.html?java/security/MessageDigest.html[MessageDigest] +
{nbsp}{nbsp}{nbsp}{nbsp}{nbsp}They receive the same blocks in order to reduce the I/O +
{nbsp}{nbsp}{nbsp}{nbsp}{nbsp}and therefore read only once each block

image::hash-blocks-en.png[]
